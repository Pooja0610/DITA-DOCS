    <p><b>PowerQUICC MPC8306KIT Userâ€™s Guide</b></p>
    <p>The MPC8306KIT is a two-board system. The processor board (SOM) features the PowerQUICC
      processor, MPC8306, and memory interfaces. The other board is called carrier card that
      comprises external world interfaces terminated on connector/header.</p>
    <p>This is a low-cost, high-performance system solution comprising printed circuit board (PCB)
      assembly plus a software board support package (BSP) distributed in a CD image. This BSP
      enables the fastest possible time-to-market for development or integration of applications
      including telecom application, industrial control, networking and low-end embedded
      application.</p>
    <p>This document describes the hardware features of the board including specifications, block
      diagram, connectors, interfaces, and hardware straps. It also describes the board settings and
      physical connections needed to boot the MPC8306KIT. Finally, it considers the software shipped
      with the platform.</p>
