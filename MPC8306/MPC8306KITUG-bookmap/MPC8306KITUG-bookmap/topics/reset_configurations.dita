    <p>An MPC8306KIT module generates single reset to the MPC8306 and other peripherals on the
      board. The reset unit provides power-on reset, hard reset, and soft reset signals in
      compliance with the MPC8306 hardware specification. <xref
        href="#topic_a3z_tfk_c4b/fig_yfl_sqx_c4b" format="dita"/>Shows the reset scheme on
      board.</p>
    <ul id="ul_klj_dsq_c4b">
      <li>MPC8306_POR# (power on reset) input is generated by TI power management IC TPS65023. When
        MR# (manual reset) is deasserted and 3.3 V is ready, the TPS65023 internal timeout
        guarantees a minimum reset active time of 100 ms before PORESET# is deasserted. Push button
        reset interfaces the MR# signal with debounce capability to produce a manual master
        PORESET#. MPC8306 POR# input is also generated by MC9RS08KA2 microcontroller device by
        monitoring I<sup>2</sup>C-I/O expander GPIO status based on loading of reset configuration
        word from boot device on SOM board.</li>
      <li>HRESET# (hard reset) is generated either by the MPC8306 or the COP/JTAG port.</li>
      <li>COP/JTAG port reset provides convenient hard-reset capability for a COP/JTAG controller.
        The HRESET# line is available at the COP/JTAG port connector. The COP/JTAG controller can
        directly generate the hard-reset signal by asserting this line low. As shown in below
        figure, the COP can independently assert HRESET# or TRST#, while ensuring that the MPC8306
        can drive HRESET# as well.</li>
      <li>Carrier_RST# is used to provide power on reset signal to the devices on carrier card. This
        signal is generated by ANDing Carrier_POR# and HRESET# signal generated by MPC8306.</li>
    </ul>
